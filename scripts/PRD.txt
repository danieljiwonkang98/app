# Overview
The AI Interview Cheating Detection Desktop Application is a sophisticated monitoring tool designed to detect and prevent cheating during remote technical interviews. Built with Electron and React, this cross-platform desktop application runs on the interviewee’s computer, providing a secure and transparent monitoring solution that respects privacy while ensuring interview integrity.

This product addresses the growing problem of AI-assisted cheating in technical interviews, where candidates use AI tools like ChatGPT to generate responses in real-time. By running locally, the application can detect suspicious activities that web-based solutions cannot identify, offering minimal false positives. Primary users include:
- Job candidates participating in remote technical interviews
- Technical hiring teams overseeing these interviews
- Companies seeking to protect the integrity of their hiring process

# Core Features
1. Secure Authentication System  
   - Interview Code Entry  
   - Session Management (automatic session creation/termination)  
   - Secure Connection (end-to-end encrypted)  
   - Identity Verification (webcam)  

2. Transparent Permission System  
   - Clear Permission Requests  
   - Granular Control  
   - Visual Indicators (showing active monitoring)  
   - Privacy Controls (temporary pause for legitimate reasons)  

3. Multi-Modal Cheating Detection  
   - Screen Monitoring (capture screen content)  
   - Process Monitoring (track running applications)  
   - Text Analysis (detect AI-generated text patterns)  
   - Audio Analysis (detect reading from scripts)  
   - Network Traffic Analysis (flag known AI service connections)  

4. Minimal UI During Interviews  
   - Distraction-Free Interface  
   - Status Indicators (show monitoring status)  
   - Notification System (discreet prompts for permissions/issues)  
   - Interview Timer  

5. Privacy-First Design  
   - Local Processing (where possible)  
   - Minimal Data Collection  
   - Transparent Monitoring  
   - Data Retention Controls (automatic data deletion post-interview)  

# User Experience
1. Pre-Interview Setup  
   - Interviewee receives invitation with unique code  
   - Downloads and installs desktop application  
   - Application performs system requirements check  

2. Interview Initialization  
   - User enters unique interview code  
   - Application requests necessary permissions with clear explanations  
   - Connection test with interviewer dashboard  
   - Baseline monitoring begins to establish normal usage patterns  

3. During Interview  
   - Monitoring runs in the background with minimal UI  
   - Detection algorithms analyze multiple signals for suspicious patterns  
   - Interviewee completes tasks uninterrupted  
   - status indicators confirm active monitoring  

4. Post-Interview  
   - Monitoring data is securely transmitted to interviewer dashboard  
   - Local data deleted according to retention policy  
   - Interviewee receives session completion confirmation  
   - Optional feedback form about application experience  

# Technical Architecture
- Built with Electron (desktop wrapper) and React (UI)  
- Integrations for screen capture, process monitoring, and secure data handling  
- Data encrypted in transit to the interviewer dashboard  
- Audio/video capture modules  
- Supabase for backend and datastorage

# Development Roadmap
• Phase 1 (MVP):  
  - Implement secure authentication and basic monitoring (screen + process)  
  - Minimal UI for interview state and permission management  
  - Local processing of data and immediate encryption for transmission  
• Phase 2 (Enhancements):  
  - Add audio analysis, text analysis for AI-generated patterns  
  - Expand feature toggles for transparency and privacy controls  
  - Integrate optional identity verification systems  
• Phase 3 (Extended Capabilities):  
  - Introduce advanced analytics and detection heuristics  
  - Further UI/UX refinements  
  - Expand language support in the integrated code editor  

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Foundational permissions and authentication must be fully functional before advanced monitoring modules  
- MVP requires quick path to active detection and minimal false positives  
- Future enhancements build on baseline monitoring systems  

# Risks and Mitigations
- Technical Challenges: High resource usage or conflict with OS-level permissions mitigated by thorough testing  
- Data Sensitivity: Strict retention/integrity controls  
- Conceptual Acceptance: Provide transparent UI to assure users of privacy
