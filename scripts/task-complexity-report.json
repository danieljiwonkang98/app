      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Electron and React project setup into specific technical steps including initialization, configuration, and structure setup. Include specific tooling decisions and configuration files that need to be created.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical configurations and architectural decisions. While it's a standard development setup, it requires careful configuration of Electron with React, webpack, and establishing proper project structure. The interdependencies between main and renderer processes add complexity."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the specific steps to implement Supabase authentication in an Electron app, including API configuration, UI components, session management, and security measures for interview code validation.",
      "reasoning": "Authentication implementation with Supabase involves multiple components: backend configuration, secure token storage, session management, and UI development. The interview code validation adds custom logic beyond standard auth flows. Security considerations and encryption requirements increase complexity."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the permission system implementation into specific components including permission request dialogs, status indicators, persistence mechanisms, and the central permission management service with its API.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex permission management across multiple sensitive areas (screen, processes, webcam, audio). It requires careful UI design for transparency, state management for permissions, and secure persistence. The privacy pause feature with reason logging adds additional complexity."
